# hello-world
Hey everyone,
I am a 33 year old who is looking to start a new career as a Python developer. So far I am enjoying the learning experience very much. I hope to learn as much as possible to be as ready as possible for my first job as an engineer assistant. I will hopefully be writing automation scripts.
